# PC-correlated SNPs

Identified SNPs in reference populations excessively associated with genome-wide principle component 1 for **MAF=0.05**, which differentiates between _E. globulus_ and _E. cordata_ samples using the `R` package [`pcadapt`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcadapt/index.html).
