# Population Statistics

Characterize the three "populations", Meehan Range _E. globulus_, reference _E. globulus_, and Meehan Range _E. cordata_ using general population statistics.

## Sliding Window Stats

Nucleotide diversity within all populations, between all, between references:

```bash
# Done on UFRC queue system, see pi_pops.job
# Maximum resources used:
```

Dxy between reference populations:

```bash
# Done on UFRC queue system, see dxy_pops.job
# Maximum resources used:
```

Expected heterozygosity within all populations and within _E. globulus_

```bash
# Done on UFRC queue system, see he_pops.job
# Maximum resources used:
```

FST between all populations:
(See if you can get this working for the genome scan stuff first.)
