I called the SNPs using the GATK pipeline (bwa-HaplotypeCaller-VQSR), as the lack of gold SNP dataset, 
I constructed one using the SNPs from high-depth samples after stringent filtering. 
The filtering parameters for the gold dataset includes:
Mapping Quality (>50), 
Missing Rate (<10%), 
Minor Allele Frequency (>0.25), 
Depth (DP in the range of meanÂ±sd), 
QD/QUAL score normalized by allele depth (>20), 
StrandOddsRatio (|SOR|<1, evaluating whether there is strand bias in the data), 
ExcessHet (ExcessHet<10, the probability of the called samples exhibiting excess heterozygosity), 
BaseQRankSum (|BaseQRankSum|<1, comparing the base qualities of the data supporting the 
reference allele with those supporting the alternate allele). 

Then the VQSR was applied to filter raw SNPs which were called from the dataset of all samples.
